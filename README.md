## Architectures

Currently supports:

- x86-family

## Structure

- `docs` - Documentation
- `nova` - Kernel source code
- `sysroot` - The initial file system of the OS
- `qemu` - Emulation scripts

## Build

Install the following dependencies:

- `build-essential`
- `make`
- `nasm`
- `grub2`

## Run OS

To test out the OS, run `make test-32` in the root of the repository. This will:
